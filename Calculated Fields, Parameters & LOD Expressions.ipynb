    "### Theoretical Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: What is a Calculated Field and why is it important in business dashboards?**\n",
    "- A calculated field is a custom formula created from existing data in Tableau.\n",
    "- It’s important because it creates KPIs (like profit margin), applies business logic, and turns raw data into meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Why can’t parameters change visuals directly in Tableau?**\n",
    "- Parameters are just input values. They don’t affect visuals unless used inside calculated fields, filters, or reference lines. They need logic to drive changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: When should EXCLUDE LOD be used?**\n",
    "- Use EXCLUDE when you want to remove a dimension from the view’s level of detail—commonly for percent-of-total or comparing detail vs summary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Difference between FIXED and INCLUDE LOD expressions?**\n",
    "- FIXED: Locks calculation at specified dimensions, ignores the view.\n",
    "- INCLUDE: Adds a dimension to the current view’s level of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple rule:\n",
    "  - FIXED = lock level\n",
    "  - INCLUDE = add level\n",
